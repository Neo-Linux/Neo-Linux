- 👋 Hi, I’m @Neo-Linux

- 👀 I’m interested in Tech, Music, Gaming, 3D Printing, Programming, Networking, making and learning new things...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux (CLI, Bash, ARCHLinux, experimenting with different distros), System Admin for Linux Servers, AWS (Cloud as a whole), Networking (CCNA, CompTIA, Network+), Programming/Scripting (VSCode, [Code]cademy:Pro, Python, HTML/CSS, PHP, Java, SQL), 3D Printing/Design (Fusion360, FreeCAD, Cura Slicer, Thingiverse, Blender) + (Hardware:Ender-3/BigTreeTech-SKR-E3-V2+TFT35-E3-V3/Marlin.CustomFirmware.PlatformIO-IDE.VSCode), Game Development/Design (UnityEngine, C#, Blender, UnrealEngine, AndroidSDK), Microcontrollers/IoT/Automation (RaspberryPi, Arduino, GPIO, Sensors/Modules)...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something in the future, I'm not quite competent enough to be of significant use currently...

- 📫 How to reach me: I guess here. I'm not on social media...
